  abstract={This paper presents a novel computer-aided diagnosis system for melanoma. The novelty lies in the optimized selection and integration of features derived from textural, border-based, and geometrical properties of the melanoma lesion. The texture features are derived from using wavelet-decomposition, the border features are derived from constructing a boundary-series model of the lesion border and analyzing it in spatial and frequency domains, and the geometry features are derived from shape indexes. The optimized selection of features is achieved by using the gain-ratio method, which is shown to be computationally efficient for melanoma diagnosis application. Classification is done through the use of four classifiers; namely, support vector machine, random forest, logistic model tree, and hidden naive Bayes. The proposed diagnostic system is applied on a set of 289 dermoscopy images (114 malignant, 175 benign) partitioned into train, validation, and test image sets. The system achieves an accuracy of 91.26% and area under curve value of 0.937, when 23 features are used. Other important findings include 1) the clear advantage gained in complementing texture with border and geometry features, compared to using texture information only, and 2) higher contribution of texture features than border-based features in the optimized feature set.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of building high-level, class-specific feature detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous {SGD} on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting with these learned features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8\% accuracy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from {ImageNet}, a leap of 70\% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {Analyzing for abnormalities of cell images in the cervix uteri provides a basis for reducing deaths and morbidity from cervical cancer through detection of potentially cancerous cells, provision of prompt advice and opportunities for follow-up and treatments. However, cytopathology is usually based on subjective interpretation of morphological features. Arbitrary criteria have to be devised for their classifications. Subjective interpretations of such criteria are likely to result in diagnostic shifts and consequently disagreement occurs between different interpreters. This article presents a novel approach to the composition of segmentation and diagnosis processes for biomedical image analysis. A prototype expert system has been developed to provide an objective and reliable tool to gynaecologists. Special image analyzing techniques are used and a set of knowledge sources is designed. The expert system employs a robust control strategy which minimizes the amount of domain-specific control knowledge. It has been proved to work effectively in the detection of cervical cancer.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) have massively influenced recent advances in large-scale image classification. More recently, a dynamic routing algorithm with capsules (groups of neurons) has shown state-of-the-art recognition performance. However, the behavior of such networks in the presence of a degrading signal (noise) is mostly unexplored. An analytical study on different network architectures toward noise robustness is essential for selecting the appropriate model in a specific application scenario. This paper presents an extensive performance analysis of six deep architectures for image classification on six most common image degradation models. In this study, we have compared {VGG}-16, {VGG}-19, {ResNet}-50, Inception-v3, {MobileNet} and {CapsuleNet} architectures on Gaussian white, Gaussian color, salt-and-pepper, Gaussian blur, motion blur and {JPEG} compression noise models.},

We propose a fully convolutional architecture, encompassing residual learning, to model the ambiguous mapping between monocular images and depth maps. In order to improve the output resolution, we present a novel way to efficiently learn feature map up-sampling within the network. For optimization, we introduce the reverse Huber loss that is particularly suited for the task at hand and driven by the value distributions commonly present in depth maps. Our model is composed of a single architecture that is trained end-to-end and does not rely on post-processing techniques, such as {CRFs} or other additional refinement steps. As a result, it runs in real-time on images or videos. In the evaluation, we show that the proposed model contains fewer parameters and requires fewer training data than the current state of the art, while outperforming all approaches on depth estimation.

	title = {A Comprehensive Overview and Comparative Analysis on Deep Learning Models: {CNN}, {RNN}, {LSTM}, {GRU}},
	abstract = {Deep learning ({DL}) has emerged as a powerful subset of machine learning ({ML}) and artificial intelligence ({AI}), outperforming traditional {ML} methods, especially in handling unstructured and large datasets. Its impact spans across various domains, including speech recognition, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, predictive analytics, and more. However, the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world problems present challenges in designing effective deep-learning models. Consequently, several deep learning models have been developed to address different problems and applications. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}), Recurrent Neural Networks ({RNNs}), Generative Models, Deep Reinforcement Learning ({DRL}), and Deep Transfer Learning. We examine the structure, applications, benefits, and limitations of each model. Furthermore, we perform an analysis using three publicly available datasets: {IMDB}, {ARAS}, and Fruit-360. We compare the performance of six renowned deep learning models: {CNN}, Simple {RNN}, Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}), Bidirectional {LSTM}, Gated Recurrent Unit ({GRU}), and Bidirectional {GRU}.},
